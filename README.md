# Trees Implementation

This repository contains implementations of various types of trees, including Binary Search Trees (BST), AVL Trees, Heaps and other types of Trees. Each implementation is written in a different programming language, including C++, Java, Python and more.

## Binary Search Trees (BST)

A binary search tree is a binary tree data structure in which the value of the left child of any node in the tree is less than or equal to the value of the node, and the value of the right child is greater than or equal to the value of the node. In this repository, you will find implementations of BSTs in various programming languages.

## AVL Trees

An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree in which the heights of the left and right subtrees of any node differ by at most one. The implementation of AVL Trees in this repository also includes methods for rotations and rebalancing.

## Heaps

A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property: if P is a parent node of C, then the key (the value) of P is either greater than or equal to (in a max heap) or less than or equal to (in a min heap) the key of C. The implementation of heaps in this repository includes both max and min heaps.


## Usage

Each implementation is contained in its own directory and includes instructions on how to compile and run the code. Simply navigate to the directory of the implementation you are interested in and follow the instructions.
